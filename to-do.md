# Project Planning

## Requirements Analysis

- Review the requirements below and plan your implementation approach
- Create a project plan outlining the components, state management strategy, and TypeScript interfaces you’ll need.
- Consider how you’ll handle form validation, state updates, and component communication.

### Component Planning

- Plan the hierarchy and communication between components.
- Design the TypeScript interfaces for your components and data structures.
- Consider how you’ll implement the filtering and sorting functionality.

# Implementation

## Type Definitions (types/index.ts)

Define TypeScript interfaces for:

- [ ] Task data structure
- [ ] Component props
- [ ] Form data
- [ ] Filter options

## Task Management Components

### TaskList Component:

- [ ] Implement list rendering with proper key management
- [ ] Handle task status updates
- [ ] Implement task addition
- [ ] Implement task deletion
- [ ] Add sorting functionality
- [ ] Add a search bar to search for tasks

### TaskForm Component:

- [ ] Create a controlled form for adding/editing tasks
- [ ] Implement form validation
- [ ] Handle form submission
- [ ] Show validation feedback

### TaskFilter Component:

- [ ] Implement filtering by status and priority
- [ ] Add search functionality
- [ ] Show active filter indicators

### Dashboard Component:

- [ ] Compose all components into a cohesive dashboard
- [ ] Implement responsive layout
- [ ] Add task statistics
- [ ] Handle component communication

### Utility Functions

- [ ] Implement task filtering logic
- [ ] Add sorting functions
- [ ] Create validation helpers
- [ ] Add date formatting utilities

### Data Persistence

- [ ] Add localStorage integration
- [ ] Implement data export/import

### Enhanced UI

- [ ] Implement task reordering
- [ ] Integrating a drag and drop library could be a fun challenge for this feature
- [ ] Add support for both light and dark mode
- [ ] Add a toggle switch to the UI for changing the theme
- [ ] Pass the theme state down to the components that need it
- [ ] Add animations and/or transitions for state changes

## Testing and Finalizing

1. ### Test Your Application:

- [ ] Test all form validations
- [ ] Verify filtering and sorting functionality
- [ ] Check responsive design
- [ ] Test component interactions

2. ### Code Review:

- [ ] Ensure TypeScript types are properly implemented
- [ ] Check for proper component composition
- [ ] Verify state management approach
- [ ] Review error handling

3. ### Documentation:

- [ ] Add comments to components and functions
- [ ] Create a README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Document component props and usage

## Deliverables

You must submit the following items via Canvas:

1. ### GitHub Repository:

- Link to your GitHub repository with the complete project code
- Ensure your repository is publicly accessible

2. ### Reflection Document:

Write a reflection addressing:<br>

### How you implemented React and TypeScript features

### The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them

### Your approach to component composition and state management

## Submission Guidelines

1. <b>GitHub Repository</b>: Submit the link to your repository on Canvas.
2. <b>Reflection Document</b>: Upload your written reflection as a separate file or include it in your repository as a Markdown file.
